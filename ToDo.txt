- Correctly modifies database but changes not reflected in multiquest

In the modal forms, text areas can be extended past the edge of the modal.

Changes in the old website are reflected in the new website.

Changes made in the new website do not reflect changes on the
old site. The old site uses some additional component in addition
to the database.

Recording:

When a question is removed, all page question links are destroyed
