<a id="brcatesting"><b>Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations</b></a>
<div>
    <p>
		Gene mutations are found in about 1 woman out of every 20 who has breast cancer. The most common gene mutations are called BRCA1 and BRCA2.
    </p>
    <p>
        These mutations are also found in 10 to 15 women out of 100 who get ovarian cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we find these genes mutations before a woman develops these cancer, we can recommend ways to make this less likely-- such as lifestyle changes, medications and/or surgery.
    </p>
    <p>
        For women who have already had these cancers before being tested, BRCA test results help guide choices to lower chances of cancer coming back.
    </p>
    <p>
		If you have had BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing and still have questions about what this means, please discuss with your care providers at your earliest convenience.
    </p>
     <p>
		If you haven't been tested, this questionnaire can help decide whether testing is recommended for you. If testing is recommended, we will advise genetic counseling so you can learn more and discuss your options.
